    <h3>Anrey Wang, LPC</h3>
    <!-- <img src="anrey-face.png" alt="black and white portrait photo of Anrey Wang smiling" id="profile_picture"> -->
    <p>I provide professional counseling and psychotherapy for individuals in Oregon, via secure video conferencing.</p>
    <p>I practice with authenticity, discerning attention, and a deep commitment to counseling excellence. As someone who identifies as (intellectually) highly gifted, I may be an especially good fit for other gifted or neurodivergent individuals.</p>
    <p>Sessions are typically 60 minutes long and cost $240 each.</p>
    <p>I do not take health insurance, do not offer a sliding scale, and do not provide superbills or statements for out-of-network insurance billing. In accordance with the <a href="https://www.cms.gov/medical-bill-rights" target="_blank">No Surprises Act</a>, I provide fee estimates in good faith at scheduling and at any time upon request.</p>
    <p>All counseling clients are subject to my <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vRt9I2IorfGYX9ML_LMtiYAHjs6k0R_HVi5602WcIhRLRoEBBraTH4chZUVlwR9YlEh2YuWaT_cYh6I/pub" target="_blank">privacy practices</a>.</p>
    <p>To schedule a free, initial consultation, please email me at my first name at this website's address. Alternatively, you can leave me a voicemail at (503) 308-9203.</p>
