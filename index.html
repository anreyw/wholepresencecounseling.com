    <p>I provide professional counseling and psychotherapy for individuals in Oregon, via secure video conferencing.</p>
    <p>I practice with authenticity, discerning attention, and a deep commitment to counseling excellence. As someone who identifies as (intellectually) highly gifted, I may be an especially good fit for other gifted or neurodivergent individuals.</p>
    <p>Sessions are typically 60 minutes long and cost $240 each.</p>
    <p>I do not take health insurance, do not offer a sliding scale, and do not provide superbills or statements for out-of-network insurance billing. By law, clients have a right to a good faith estimate of expected costs at scheduling and upon request. They are also subject to certain <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vRt9I2IorfGYX9ML_LMtiYAHjs6k0R_HVi5602WcIhRLRoEBBraTH4chZUVlwR9YlEh2YuWaT_cYh6I/pub" target="_blank">privacy practices</a>.</p>
    <p>I also provide clinical supervision for professional counselor associates and licensees practicing in Oregon. Please inquire for more details.</p>
